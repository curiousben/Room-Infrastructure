# What is Filter?

This microservice enables a BLE device (node) to detect any BLE device by using the host's BLE detection module. Once BLE signals have been detected this microservice sends the data using [curiousben's](https://hub.docker.com/u/curiousben/) redisMQ. The compatibility of this microservice is dependent on the host's BLE capabilities and access to a redis instance.
