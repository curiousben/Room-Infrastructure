/*
* Description:
*   This promise recieves a message from a source queue and places it in the destination queue then returns
*     the message.
* Args:
*   client (redisClient): A promisified redis client.
*   srcQueue (String): A string that is the name of the source queue.
*   destQueue (String): A string that is the name of the destination queue.
* Returns:
*   redisPromise (Promise) An promise that resolves with the results of a successfull publish of a message.
* Throws:
*   MessageError (Error) This error will be thrown if redis fails to send the message to the client 
* Notes:
*   Since this is not a multi argument there is a chance that if the whole promise doesn't complete there
*     will be commands that are not executed. However, every message will first be put into the process queue
*     which is handled by one Redis command. So if the client crashes midway through the promise, the checking
*     of the process queue on initialization will recover the message
* TODO:
*   N/A

/*
* Description:
*   This promise recieves a message from a source queue and places it the process queue only to consume the message.
* Args:
*   client (redisClient): A promisified redis client.
*   srcQueue (String): A string that is the name of the source queue.
*   destQueue (String): A string that is the name of the destination queue.
* Returns:
*   redisPromise (Promise) An promise that resolves with the results of a successfull publish of a message.
* Throws:
*   MessageError (Error) This error will be thrown if redis fails to send the message to the client 
* Notes:
*   While the process queue design looks like it is counter-intuitive but it was choosen for a couple of reasons:
*     1. Since we are listening for messages arriving in the upstream queue, a blocking connection is needed
*       but this can't be implemneted in a batch of commands like lua-Scripts/multi-Function since it will stop
*       the Redis server.
*     2. Due to the previous reason there will be a window where the message was received and was acted on but
*       the client has yet to execute the batched commands. The process queue is a temporary cache until the message
*       has been fully consumed.
